# Part 3 - React Components & End to End tests

In this directory we started a react app called `react-app` with the command:

```
npx create-react-app@latest react-app
```

CRA should include Jest in its default configuration.

## Cypress

- `npm install --save-dev cypress`
- `npx cypress open` -> opens browser. Following prompts will add files to your system `cypress.config.js` and the `cypress` folder.
